    Shining in glory for all men to see.
    <br></br>
    We fought for the future, destroyed by the invaders,
    And brought to our homeland the agreement of shame.
    Our story will live in the memory of nations
    And all generations will remember are name.
    <br></br>
    Long live our otoman motherland,
    Built by the allahs mighty hand.
    Long live our people, united and free.
    Strong in our sultans tried by fire.
    Long may our crimson flag inspire,
                Shining in glory for all men to see.<br></br></p>
